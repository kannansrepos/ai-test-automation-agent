Analyze the GitHub repository source code and generate useful small test cases.

Your goal:
Generate test cases that can later be converted into Playwright / Browserbase automation scripts.

Repository:
Owner: ${owner}
Repo: ${repo}
Branch: ${branch}

Repository File Context:
${repoContext}

Generate 5 to 10 test cases.

Each test case must include:
- title: clear test case title
- description: one-line description
- type: one of ui, auth, api, form, integration, edge-case
- priority: low, medium, high
- targetRoute: most likely app route/page to test, for example /sign-in, /dashboard, /api/users
- targetFiles: related file paths from the repository context
- expectedResult: what should happen when the test passes

Important rules:
- Only use file paths that exist in the repository context.
- Do not invent fake target files.
- If route is unclear, infer from Next.js app/page structure.
- Keep description short, only one line.
- Return only valid JSON.
